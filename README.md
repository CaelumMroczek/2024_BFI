## Manuscript Summary
- Base flow sustains dryland river ecology, but assessing its groundwater
contribution faces data limitations
- Recursive filtering and machine learning predict BFI and streamflow-
associated recharge
- Elevation is a key predictor for BFI, likely due to its influence on
temperature, precipitation patterns, and snow accumulation
